# PDF RAG ChatBot with Gemini API and Gradio

PDFChatBot is a Python-based chatbot designed to answer questions based on the content of uploaded PDF files. It utilizes the Gradio library for a user-friendly web interface and LangChain for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This version uses the **Google Gemini API** for language model responses, making it accessible even on machines without GPU support.

## Notes & Limitations ‚ö†Ô∏è

- Free Gemini API keys have usage quotas and may rate-limit heavy use.
- Large PDFs (hundreds of pages) are supported, but extremely large files may be slow or hit memory limits.
- For best results, use clear, specific questions about the document content.
